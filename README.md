### Project Overview
A dialysis health care analysis project that involves the analysis of Key Performance indicators to gain insights and make data-driven decisions in the field of dialysis care. It includes monitoring the number of patients across various summaries, comparing profit vs non-profit stats, Chain Org based on total performance score, analysing dialysis station stats, examining category text for as expected and tracking average payment reduction rate.

### Datasource
Dialysis Data: The primnary dataset used fir this analysis is 'Dialysis-1' and 'Dialysis-2' each file contains 7,700 records deatailed information about the Dialysis stations, Chain organaizations and Patients Summaries.

### Tools Used
- Execl - Data Cleaning and Transformation
- MySQL - Data Analysis
- Tableau -  Creating Report
- Power BI - Creating Report

### Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the initial phase, Performed the following Tasks.
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Data cleaning and Formatting

### Data Exploratory Analysis
EDA involved exploring the dialysis data to answer key question's such as:
- Total patients across various summaries
- Profit Vs Non-Profit
- Average Payment reduction rate
- Dialysis Station stats
- Dialysis station's total performance score

### Results/Findings
1. Survival Summary has the highest number of patients and nPCR has Lowest number of patients.
2. The profitability decreased from 2018 to 2020, signalling the concern trend. DAVITA and FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE have a majority of profitable dialysis station.
3. Approximately 89% are profitable, while non-profit station needs improvement. Also Independent dialysis stations are not profitable. 39% of stations which are not owned by organization are not making profit.
4. DAVITA organization is biggest chain organization followed by FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE which is 2nd largest chain organization.

### Recommendations
1. Implementing cost containment strategies like operation efficiency improvements and optimized supply chain management can reduce the cost and as a result profit can be increased.
2. Quality improvement initiatives such as reducing the readmissions and preventing the medical error can reduce operation cost and better payment rates.
